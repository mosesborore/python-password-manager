# PASSWORD MANAGER

I used:
    1. python
    2. PostgreSQL
    3. VSCode

If you do have PostgreSQL in your system; checkout <https://www.postgresql.org/download/> 
download the appropriate version.
The database configuration (host, port, user, database_name) used here are the default one. But if you have different configuration. Edit the <src/config.yaml> file.

The project is being tweaked here and there. If you like it just clone it and improve it.
